# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional by it being able to run as it should and there are no errors while testing. I make sure that the program achieves what the client wants it to. I can ensure that my code is secure by adding some sort of user authentication to it. This will allow it so that users cannot get access to something without the administrator’s permission. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret the users’ needs by understanding what the program or software is going to do. This would be determining the end goal of the software. By doing this I can determine the requirements and then implement them into the code. I can then test and make sure that the code is running as the user wants and that there are no errors that I may have missed. 

# How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by looking closely at the requirements either provided by the customer or determined by an interview with them. From here I can get a promising idea of how the software will layout. Then I can go ahead and code the software to meet the specifications. While I am designing though I am looking out for vulnerabilities and trying to limit the amount of personal bias while coding.
